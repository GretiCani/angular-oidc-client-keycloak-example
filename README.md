# angular-oidc-client-keycloak-example

This project is a re-implemtation of the idea described in Scott Brady's blog post [SPA Authentiction using OpenID Connect, Angular CLI and oidc-client](https://www.scottbrady91.com/Angular/SPA-Authentiction-using-OpenID-Connect-Angular-CLI-and-oidc-client).
It combines the [oidc-client-js](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js) library with a hello-world Angular single page application.

I updated the example app described in the blog post slightly to fit the latest Angular release and adapted its configuration for [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org).

In addition, it now also features a functional 'logout' button on the protected component.

The oidc-client configuration (see `src/app/services/auth.service.ts`) was tested against a realm named `demo` and a client named `angular_spa` in a recent Keycloak version.
The client in that realm is configured for the [Implicit Flow](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth) as described in the OpenID Connect specification.
When started, this example assumes a Keycloak instance, containing such a configuration, to be available at `http://localhost:8081`.

_**TODO** add Dockerfile for Keycloak including config of example realm_
